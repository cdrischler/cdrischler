## Hello there!

I'm an Assistant Professor of Physics and [FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/) Bridge Faculty at the [Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (INPP)](https://inpp.ohio.edu/~inpp/) at Ohio University. I'm also a member of the [FRIB Theory Alliance Executive Board](https://www.fribtheoryalliance.org/content/executive_board.php). 

My current research interests include:
* Neutron stars
* Equation of state of neutron-rich matter
* Chiral effective field theory
* Many-body perturbation theory
* Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification
* Emulators for nuclear physics and model (order) reduction
* Computational physics

I'm collaborating with:
* NSF Physics Frontier Center _Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries_ ([N3AS](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/))
* _Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification: Errors in Your EFT_ ([BUQEYE](https://buqeye.github.io/)) collaboration, and
* NSF Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics ([BAND](https://bandframework.github.io/)) Framework

The complete list of my publications can be found on [inspirehep.net](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1405840?ui-citation-summary=true).

Don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested in a Research Fellowship of the [Alexander von Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/) (such as the [Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship)) hosted by me at Ohio University.
