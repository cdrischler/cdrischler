### Hello there!

I'm a theoretical nuclear physicist and FRIB Theory Fellow at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams ([FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/)) and Michigan State University ([MSU](https://msu.edu/)). My current research interests include:
* Neutron stars
* Equation of state of neutron-rich matter
* Chiral effective field theory
* Many-body perturbation theory
* Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification
* Emulators and model reduction methods
* Computational physics

I'm a collaborator of the NSF Physics Frontier Center _Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries_ ([N3AS](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/)) and member of the _Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification: Errors in Your EFT_ ([BUQEYE](https://buqeye.github.io/)) collaboration.
